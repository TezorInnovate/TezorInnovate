### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Tezor
#### A student of B.Tech CSE. Learning and developing for a better tomorrow! :)
I'm Tezor and for now I'm just a student, but that isn't it. After all, we all know that the sky is the limit ;).
As a student of Engineering enrolled in the course of Computer Science and Engineering [aka CSE] my main focus is to become skilled in all areas possible. Currently, I'm learning Front-end development and a few basics of Cyber-Security. With a decent command on python, C, and C++, I look forward to learning multiple more languages and go from ZERO TO HERO!!!

Skills: HTML / CSS / C / C++ / Python

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web application for an educational platform. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data structures using C.
